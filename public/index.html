        </header>
        <p class="text">
            The Witcher is a series of fantasy novels and short stories written by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski. The series revolves around the titular "witcher", Geralt of Rivia. In Sapkowski's works, "witchers" are beast hunters who develop supernatural abilities at a young age to battle wild beasts and monsters. The books have been adapted into a television series (The Witcher), a trilogy of video games (The Witcher, The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt), and a graphic novel series. The series of novels is known as the Witcher Saga.
            <br><br>
            The books have been described as having a cult following in Poland and in Central and Eastern European countries. The video games have been very successful; as of 28 May 2020, The Witcher series has sold over 50 million copies worldwide.
