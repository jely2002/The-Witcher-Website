He loved the sorceress Yennefer, he considered her to be the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.<br><br>Geralt was the son of the sorceress Visenna and, presumably, the warrior Korin, but when he was born Visenna left him with the School of the Wolf at Kaer Morhen. There, Geralt was trained and made to be a witcher<br><br>During the Trial of the Grasses (the initiation to the Witcher craft), Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers."

She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.<br><br>Born in 1173, Yennefer had a rough childhood from the moment she was born due to her congenital hunchback. At some point, due to her magical potential, she was received in the Aretuza school for sorceresses, where rectoress Tissaia de Vries became her teacher and mother figure. In accordance with the sorceresses' tradition, any physical flaw, including her hunchback, was magically removed. Yennefer eventually graduated as a sorceress."

She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver."

He would, however, visit Oxenfurt from time to time to give guest lectures. Within a very few years he gained worldwide fame and became known as one of the best minstrels in the Northern Kingdoms, with his best known song was the Ballad of the Lion Cub of Cintra.<br><br>Dandelion first met Geralt at a fÃªte in the town of Gulet in Aedirn. There, the poet had knocked up a girl under the musician's podium, and her four sturdy brothers were looking for him all over town, threatening to geld him and cover him in pitch and sawdust."
